This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to the `innerHTML` property.  The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect usage, which involves assigning a numeric value directly to `innerHTML`. This often leads to unexpected results or runtime errors depending on the browser. The correct approach is always to assign strings to `innerHTML`, as demonstrated in `bugSolution.html`.
